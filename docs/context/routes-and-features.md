# LitterLink — Routes & Feature Status

---

## Route Map

All routes use the Next.js 16 App Router. There is no Pages Router.

| `/events` | `src/app/events/page.tsx` | Browse all published events — postcode search, radius filter, date range, map + card list |
| `/events/[id]` | `src/app/events/[id]/page.tsx` | Event detail — join/leave, share URL, map pin, photo gallery, participants, post-event stats |

### Route Protection Logic

Enforced in `src/proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 middleware replacement):

- `COMING_SOON=true` → only `/`, `/events`, and `/events/*` redirect to `/coming-soon`; all other routes (auth, admin, etc.) remain accessible
- Unauthenticated users visiting `/dashboard`, `/events/create`, `/events/[id]/edit`, or `/profile` → redirect to `/sign-in?redirectTo=…`
- Authenticated users visiting `/sign-in` or `/sign-up` → redirect to `/dashboard`
- Admin gate for `/admin/*` is enforced in `src/app/admin/layout.tsx` (checks `profiles.is_admin`)

### Search Parameters — `/events`

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `postcode` | string | — | UK postcode to centre the search |
| `radius` | number (km) | 16 | Search radius |
| `from` | ISO date string | today | Events starting from |
| `to` | ISO date string | today + 7 days | Events starting before |

## Feature Status

### Built & Shipped

#### Authentication
- Email/password sign-up with email confirmation; email preferences captured at sign-up (stored in `raw_user_meta_data`, applied on callback)
- Google OAuth sign-in
- Password reset flow (forgot-password → email link → reset-password)
- Auto profile creation on sign-up (via Supabase DB trigger)
- Auto email-preferences row creation on profile creation (via DB trigger)
- Session refresh on every request via `src/proxy.ts`
- Route protection (unauthenticated redirect to `/sign-in`)

#### Events
- Create a new litter-pick event with title, description, UK postcode (geocoded to lat/lng), address label, start/end times, max attendees, optional organiser contact details, and optional group affiliation
- Rate-limited event creation (5 per user per 24 hours — `src/lib/ratelimit.ts`)
- Input sanitization via `src/lib/sanitize.ts` (strips HTML tags)
- Events default to `published` status on creation
- Organiser can cancel an event (status → `cancelled`)
- Event detail page with full info, participant count, map pin, share URL, photo gallery (completed events), and participant list
- Verified organiser badge shown on event cards and detail pages
- Open Graph meta tags on event detail pages

#### Discovery & Map
- Browse all published/completed events at `/events`
- Postcode-based geo search with configurable radius
- Date range filtering
- Interactive Leaflet map showing all matching events with popups
- Card list alongside the map

#### Joining
- Authenticated users can join and leave events
- Real-time participant count updates via Supabase Realtime (postgres_changes subscription)
- Race-condition-safe capacity enforcement via a DB trigger (`enforce_event_capacity`) that raises `P0001/event_full`
- Rate-limited join attempts (20 per user per hour)
- Unauthenticated users redirected to sign-in when attempting to join
- Email confirmation sent to user on join; notification to organiser; email on leave or cancellation

#### Post-Event Impact Logging
Organiser-only form at `/events/[id]/stats`:
- Bags collected
- Actual attendees
- Duration (hours)
- Litter types (checkbox selection)
- Hotspot severity (1–5 scale)
- Notable brands found
- General notes
- Submitting sets event status to `completed`

#### Dashboard
- Upcoming confirmed events (joined)
- Past attended events
- All organised events
- Groups created by the user
- Verified-organiser badge and prompt to apply if not yet verified
- Quick links to profile and create event

#### Profile
- Edit display name, home postcode
- Upload avatar (JPEG/PNG/WebP, ≤ 5 MB) stored in Supabase Storage
- Avatar shown in navbar
- Email preference management (transactional and marketing opt-ins)
- Account deletion — removes personal data, sets FK to null on events/groups, deletes auth user

#### Photos
- Completed events show a photo gallery (`EventPhotosGallery`)
- Participants can upload photos to completed events (`PhotoUpload` component, stored in `event-photos` bucket)

#### Verified Organiser System
- Any user can apply at `/become-a-verified-organiser`
- Application collects motivation, experience, organisation name, and social links
- Admin is notified by email on submission; applicant receives a confirmation email
- Admins can approve or reject at `/admin/applications`
- Approval email sent to applicant; `profiles.is_verified_organiser` set to `true`
- Verified badge displayed on events and group pages

#### Groups
- Verified organisers can create groups at `/groups/create` (name, description, type, logo, website, social, contact email)
- Group profile page at `/groups/[slug]` — shows logo, type, description, links, member count, join/leave button, organisers section, members section (with avatar chips linking to profiles), and upcoming/past events
- Group owners can edit groups at `/groups/[slug]/edit` — updates name, slug, description, type, website/social/contact details, and logo changes are published immediately
- Groups can be affiliated with events at creation time
- Group name and slug appear on `EventCard` and event detail
- Groups are joinable — `group_members` table with `role` (`'member'` \| `'organiser'`)
- `JoinGroupButton` (`src/components/groups/JoinGroupButton.tsx`) — optimistic join/leave toggle; unauthenticated users redirected to sign-in
- Creator is automatically enrolled as `'organiser'` on group creation
- Creators cannot leave their own group — enforced at application layer and by a DB trigger (`enforce_creator_cannot_leave`)
- Self-insert RLS policy restricts `role` to `'member'` only — prevents API-level self-promotion to organiser
- Rate-limited group joins (10 per user per hour — `isGroupJoinRateLimited` in `src/lib/ratelimit.ts`)

#### Email Notifications (via Resend, `src/lib/email.ts`)
- Organiser application submitted → admin notification + applicant confirmation
- Application approved/rejected → outcome email to applicant
- Event created → confirmation email to organiser (`sendEventCreatedEmail`)
- Event joined → confirmation email to participant
- Event left → notification email
- Event cancelled → notification to all confirmed participants
- Event date/time or location changed → notification to all confirmed participants (`sendEventUpdatedEmails`); rate-limited to once per 15 minutes per event (tracked via `events.reschedule_notified_at`)
- In-process rate limiting (60-second cooldown per key) to prevent burst sends

#### Admin Panel
- `/admin/applications` — list all organiser applications (pending + reviewed)
- Approve/reject with one click; triggers email and profile update
- Access gated by `profiles.is_admin = true` (set manually in DB)

#### Infrastructure
- Pre-launch coming-soon gate (toggled via `COMING_SOON` env var; scoped to home and events routes)
- Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights integrated
- Row-Level Security on all tables
- PWA manifest (`src/app/manifest.ts`)
- Open Graph meta in root layout and event detail pages
- `sitemap.ts` and `robots.ts` present
- Supabase Edge Function `send-event-reminders` (`supabase/functions/send-event-reminders/`) — Deno function scheduled every 4 hours via pg_cron + pg_net. Finds published events that ended > 12 hours ago with no stats and emails the organiser a reminder to log impact. Sets `events.stats_reminder_sent_at` after sending so the reminder is never repeated.
- Rate limiting for event creation, event joins, and group joins
